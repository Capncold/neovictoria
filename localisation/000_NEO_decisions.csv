build_neostrada_title;Build the NeoStrada;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
build_neostrada_desc;The idea of a Pan-European highway has existed since the conquest of Moscow in the early 1800s, but due to bureaucratic red tape, lack of funding, and general technological limits, we have been unable to. With new innovations, it seems that a Pan-European highway might be in our future, but first we must do some testing. Poland offers us the perfect starting point due to its central location, and the insight gained here will be invaluable for future construction. The NeoStrada or "New Highway" will be built upon the latest in CyberScape research thus far and show the world that the Cyberstate is always at the forefront of science.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;

reconquer_cyberida_desc;The Siberian Web Revolt in 1827 brought our nation to the brink of destruction and allowed all sorts of vultures to take whatever they wanted from our great realm. One such state, Cyberia, has ammassed a formidable expanse in what was once our core territory. It is time we retake what is ours from those internet pretenders and let the glory of American Law shine throughout Siberia.\n\n\n§ROccupying Tomsk and Yakutsk will greatly shorten the war.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
reconquer_baikal_title;Punish the Mongols;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
reconquer_baikal_desc;Now that we have destroyed the vultures among our own ranks, we go abroad.

reconquer_eastberia_title;To the Coast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
reconquer_eastberia_desc;In America, Earl believed in a great nation that spanned from sea to shining sea. While we have a great nation, it's sadly landlocked for any real naval purpose, so we must retake our coastline from the Inuit traitors to rectify this, and someday we may retake our other lands to truly live this mission.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
invoke_constitution_title;Invoke the Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
invoke_constitution_desc;Our great state is nigh unbreakable, and due to our growing strength and Cyberstate weakness, the time has never been better to retake Europe. However, this will be a great challenge, and to overcome it our great Commander in Chief Justice must use the full might of American law to bring us to new heights so that we may tower over the Cyberstate. With the Constitution behind us, who can stand against us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
brexit_referendum_title;Brexit Referendum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
brexit_referendum_desc;The growing list of grievances we have faced from our continental counterparts can grow no more. It is time we leave this once great union and forge our own path. We were once the most feared and respected nation in the world, let us reach that great height once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
support_gopniks_title;Support the Gopnik Commune?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
support_gopniks_desc;A truly massive revolt has broken out in the heartlands of the Cyberstate's Russian territories, and its success may mean a great deal of gain for us. By supporting this revolt we could further our ambitions past the Urals with only a relatively minor cost to ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
reconquer_eurussia_title;Restore our Home;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
reconquer_eurussia_desc;Now is the time to retake what we lost all those decades ago! We have crossed the Urals and drove both the pretenders and the Cyberstate from our rightful claims, it is now time to unite Russia and dominate Eastern Europe once again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;

kill_oswald_desc;With New Orleans in our hands, we can finally fulfill the true goal of the Warren Commission, to prevent the Kennedy assassination by killing Lee Harvey Oswald first. Although he hasn't been born just yet, by stationing agents in the city to act undercover for a few decades we can be sure that as soon as Oswald comes into this world he will be taken right out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
show_aryan_decisions_title;Show Aryan Decisions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
show_aryan_decisions_desc;A great deal of Indo-Aryan cultures lie scattered across the Indian subcontinent. It is time that we take steps to unify them under a single banner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;

ARY_embrace_panjabi_title;Reincorporate the Panjabi;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
ARY_embrace_panjabi_desc;Although our great leader Adif Haldar is himself a Panjabi, due to his pan-nationalist rhetoric and our attempts to integrate all the Aryans of the subcontinent, he has distanced himself from many outside of Delhi. By showing the greatness of our state and further developing our country we will easily win them back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
ARY_embrace_rajput_title;Integrate the Rajput;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
ARY_embrace_rajput_desc;The Rajput, one of the earliest supporters of our state, have always been close allies of the regime. Indeed, their support proved critical at the Second Battle of Plassey where a combined contingent of our forces decisively defeated the Cyberstate and annexed Bihar and Bengal. Their contributions have not been in vain, with our increasing rise to power there's no better time to fully integrate them into the regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
ARY_embrace_avadhi_title;Integrate the Avadhi;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
ARY_embrace_avadhi_desc;Ali Khan Jinnah was one of the greatest opponents of the early Aryan Nation, his forces getting as far as Meerut before being decisively destroyed in open battle. Since those days, the Avadhi people have shown nothing but loyalty to our regime, the past war seemingly gone from the minds of the people. Their loyalty should be rewarded, and now that we have a great and advanced state we should make inroads to unite them with our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
